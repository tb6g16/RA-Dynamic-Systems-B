def conv(traj1, traj2):
    """
        This function calculates the convolution sum of the modes for two
        trajectories (corresponding to multiplication in the time domain).

        Parameters
        ----------
        traj1: Trajectory object
            the first trajectory to evaluate the sum over
        traj2: Trajectory object
            the second trajectory to evaluate the sum over
        
        Returns
        -------
        conv_sum: Trajectory object
            the resulting modes from the convolution sum (corresponding to a
            new trajectory)
